# Calculator
This is a simple calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The HTML structure consists of a <div> element with the class "calculator" that contains an <input> element for displaying the result and multiple <button> elements for input and operations.

The CSS styling is applied to create a visually appealing calculator interface. The calculator has a fixed width, background color, border radius, and padding.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the calculator. It defines three functions:

appendToInput(value): This function appends the specified value to the input field. It retrieves the current value of the input field and adds the new value to it.
clearInput(): This function clears the input field by setting its value to an empty string.
calculate(): This function evaluates the expression entered in the input field using the eval() function and assigns the result back to the input field.
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can enter numbers and perform calculations by clicking the buttons.

Overall, this code provides a functional calculator interface where users can enter expressions and perform calculations.
